#The Great maze.
Misdirection will be your guidance, through the path of avoiding violence.

#The Door
Behind the door lies a great light, a gift from the heavens, to vanish the endless night.
A boon of life and unimaginable imagination. 
But from the shadows, created of the light, came and arose powerful, creatures of the night. 
So far underground the flower was taken, to be hid from the world, and all its creation.
For with it the shadows followed, to rest until the world is hollow.

#Notes
To the tower came many folks, each with hope in their hearts and homes each farther away than the last.
Some sought immortality, others the wealth of world.
Nevertheless what the sought, great gifts of the heavens would be theirs.
but so far none have claimed the heavens gift.
For man made it so, and perhaps so it shall be.

Some say that the flower projects dreams unto reality, and so the world is made so.

What are these terrible things that roam this place? Demons?

#Intro 1.0
And the rest of you? You came here alone? Wow. That really takes some courage.
Whom am I? The name doesn't matter since I can't remember it.
Anyway. I bet you are here for the gift of celestial skies?
Of course you are, why else. No one ever comes here for anything else. Except me, I think....
I can help, I can provide you with the helpful items I have collected, for a fee of course.

#Intro 1.0 outro
I'll see you around i guess. If you survive that is.
Oh, and by the time we meet again I'll come up with a name for myself.

#misc
#1.0
If you want to know, there is a sentient talking flame somewhere around this place.
He's friendly so don't worry.
#1.1
So you met the flame? was he as friendly as I said?
Did he have a warm heart? Ha ha ha ha ha...

#2.0
Some say that this place was built to lure in and trap the greedy of the world.
Perhaps that is true for most, but some have come here to bring back their lords or their kind and loved.
If that is greed than I don't know who I am.
#2.1
But why would you.
#2.2
I Wonder what the folk-tales now say of this place, or perhaps its mention is taboo.

#3.0
When you are tired and looking for a shoulder you can cry on,
won't you think about me?
#3.1
And when you find the flower,
won't you think about me?

#5.0
Not long ago, I saw men with eyes as small as...
They were small and they spoke a language I never heard before.
They must have been rich though since most of them wore some sort of garb made of silk or part.

#5.1
They gave me this though.
I don't know what it is. You take it, I have no use for it.
(gives item of Chinese origin) 

#6.0
They say that there is a child from the cosmos, a kin of the celestial skies, resting in this very place.
Whatever that means, I do not know. This place convolutes reality that much I know.

#9.0
Where I am from? well I don't remember so much about except that it was really warm during some periods,
and that there was an ocean. Perhaps an island or a peninsula.

#9.1
Oh, what I miss the warmth.

#10.0
I have completely lost track of how long I have been here.
Each group of hopeful souls that arrive, always looks different and more exotic than the last.
Say? Does Rome still stand?
And whom is this Lord in the clouds that all refer to?

#10.1
Am I immortal?  if so, what do you think happens if I leave this place?
If I'm bound to this place, it wouldn't matter. I'm just glad that I live.
Though alive, it can get boring sometimes.
